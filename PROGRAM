# Ronaldo is professor at the Informatics Department in the State 
# University of Maringa - Brazil.

# Contacts with him can be done by e_mail: ronaldo@din.uem.br
# More details about him can be found in http://www.din.uem.br/~ronaldo
#
# This work was done as part of his PhD thesis in the SEMPRE project.
# His advisor was Dr. Philippe Navaux from Federal University of Rio 
# Grande do Sul - Brazil and contacts with him can be done by e-mail:
# navaux@inf.ufrgs.br
# 
# Also, the professors Mateo Valero and Eduard Ayguade from UPC/Barcelona
# help Ronaldo to do this simulator, during a technological interchange 
# accomplished at the labs of the DAC/UPC. Contacts with them can be done
# by e_mail: mateo@ac.upc.es and eduard@ac.upc.es, respectively.
#
#  The applications bellow will be executed by SS_SMT in-order until
#  complete the total determined by USED_SLOTS

#  If you need change the order, applications and/or pathnames, but keep
#  at least USED-SLOTS applications
