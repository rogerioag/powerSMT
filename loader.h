 * modified loader.h - program loader routines for SS_SMT 1.0 simulator
 *
 * This file was adapted by Ronaldo A. L. Goncalves using 
 * the original loader.h file from SimpleScalar 3.0 Tool.
 *
 * Ronaldo is professor at the Informatics Department in the State 
 * University of Maringa - Brazil. 
 *
 * Contacts with him can be done by e_mail: ronaldo@din.uem.br
 * More details about him can be found in http://www.din.uem.br/~ronaldo
 *
 * This work was done as part of his PhD thesis in the SEMPRE project.
 * His advisor was Dr. Philippe Navaux from Federal University of Rio 
 * Grande do Sul - Brazil and contacts with him can be done by e-mail:
 * navaux@inf.ufrgs.br
 * 
 * Also, the professors Mateo Valero and Eduard Ayguade from UPC/Barcelona
 * help Ronaldo to do this simulator, during a technological interchange 
 * accomplished at the labs of the DAC/UPC. Contacts with them can be done
 * by e_mail: mateo@ac.upc.es and eduard@ac.upc.es, respectively.
 *
 * The original loader.h file is a part of the SimpleScalar tool suite written by
 * Todd M. Austin as a part of the Multiscalar Research Project.
 *  
 * The SimpleScalar suite is currently maintained by Doug Burger and Todd M. Austin.

 * Adaptation 1.0  1999/11/10  Ronaldo A. L. Goncalves
 * The original loader.h was adapted to support the ss_smt.c version 1.0.
 * The main adaptations were:
 * 1) Many structures and variables were "replicated" in order to support many
 *    independent pipelines (called slots).
 * 2) Many functions were modified to include the "slot's number" parameter 
 *    passing. 
 * 3) Many function calls were modified to pass the slot's number argument

/*
 * This module implements program loading.  The program text (code) and
 * initialized data are first read from the program executable.  Next, the
 * program uninitialized data segment is initialized to all zero's.  Finally,
 * the program stack is initialized with command line arguments and
 * environment variables.  The format of the top of stack when the program
 * starts execution is as follows:
 *
 * 0x7fffffff    +----------+
 *               | unused   |
 * 0x7fffc000    +----------+
 *               | envp     |
 *               | strings  |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argv     |
 *               | strings  |
 *               +----------+
 *               | envp     |
 *               | array    |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argv     |
 *               | array    |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argc     |
 * regs_R[29]    +----------+
 * (stack ptr)
 *
 * NOTE: the start of envp is computed in crt0.o (C startup code) using the
 * value of argc and the computed size of the argv array, the envp array size
 * is not specified, but rather it is NULL terminated, so the startup code
 * has to scan memory for the end of the string.
