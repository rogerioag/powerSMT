 * modified regs.h -  architected registers state routines for SS_SMT 1.0 simulator
 *
 * This file was adapted by Ronaldo A. L. Goncalves using 
 * the original regs.h file from SimpleScalar 3.0 Tool.
 *
 * Ronaldo is professor at the Informatics Department in the State 
 * University of Maringa - Brazil. 
 *
 * Contacts with him can be done by e_mail: ronaldo@din.uem.br
 * More details about him can be found in http://www.din.uem.br/~ronaldo
 *
 * This work was done as part of his PhD thesis in the SEMPRE project.
 * His advisor was Dr. Philippe Navaux from Federal University of Rio 
 * Grande do Sul - Brazil and contacts with him can be done by e-mail:
 * navaux@inf.ufrgs.br
 * 
 * Also, the professors Mateo Valero and Eduard Ayguade from UPC/Barcelona
 * help Ronaldo to do this simulator, during a technological interchange 
 * accomplished at the labs of the DAC/UPC. Contacts with them can be done
 * by e_mail: mateo@ac.upc.es and eduard@ac.upc.es, respectively.
 *
 * The original regs.h file is a part of the SimpleScalar tool suite written by
 * Todd M. Austin as a part of the Multiscalar Research Project.

 * Adaptation 1.0  1999/11/10  Ronaldo A. L. Goncalves
 * The original regs.h was adapted to support the ss_smt.c version 1.0.
 * The main adaptations were:
 * 1) Many functions were modified to include the "slot's number" parameter 
 *    passing. 
 * 2) Many function calls were modified to pass the slot's number argument
